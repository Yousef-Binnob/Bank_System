# Bank System Console Application
The Bank System Console Application is a C++ project that implements a simple and basic functionality of a bank system. It is designed as a console application and focuses on core features such as password encryption, logging registration, and file-based data storage.

## Key Features
-**Password Encryption:** The application provides password encryption to ensure the security of user credentials and protect sensitive information.

-**Logging Registration:** Users can register their activities and transactions through logging, allowing for easy tracking and auditing of banking operations.

-**File-Based Data Storage:** The project utilizes a file-based system to store and retrieve data. This approach enables efficient management of customer information, account details, and transaction records.

-**Object-Oriented Design:** The Bank System Console Application follows an object-oriented design, separating screen classes (presentation) from core classes (business logic). This design promotes code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

The project is written in C++ and provides a foundation for building a more extensive banking system. It can serve as a starting point for developers interested in creating console-based banking applications with essential features.
